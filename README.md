# UFOs
## Purpose

After creating a webpage with a dynamic table working as intended, to improve the webpage a in-depth analysis of UFO sightings was created to allow users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.

## Results
In order filter the data of UFO sightings, the user can either enter a date: 
![date](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85198012/185475688-e33b2a76-1239-4e21-9d8a-c3779e1fccc0.png)

City:

State:

Country:

Shape:

Or a user can fill in all the criterias:

##Summary:

One drawback of this webpage is a user is not able to clear the filter criteria unless they refresh the page. In order to fix this issue, a clear button can be added so that the user is able to do a new search without having to refresh the page. Another update that can be useful is putting a list of cities, states, country and shapes so that the user can have a key to have a better idea of the data available.
